# Armoured Vehicle Framework
This is a modified version of nrlulz' ACF with all the artillery, weapons, etc. stripped out, leaving only the core vehicle building features of the addon. Handy for servers where the combat side of Garry's Mod is unwanted or not required, leaving just a good base for vehicle making.
