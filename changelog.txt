- n0th1ng1996 (+ thegrb93):
- Changed terminal ballistics for all rounds, introduced armour breaching (aka overmatching)
- Added detonator bounce angles for explosive rounds except APHE.
- Fixed HEAT bug, HEAT should now perform better.
- Fixed entity:acfRoundType()
- PolySteam:
- Patched instant-reload bug.
- shadow7483147:
- Patched entity:acfFuelRequired()

*r618
- Merged in community changes from thegrb93.  Thanks!
- Fixed gearbox brake and added torque limit to prevent crashing/spontaneous deletion.
- Optimized inertia calculation.

*r621
- Another change from thegrb93!
- Fixed cases of infinite ricochet + suspected ammobox lag by limiting bullet ricochets to 3.

*r625
- Optimization by thegrb93:
- Optimized gearbox torque application.

*r627
- Update courtesy of Red and Stovokor
- Minor engine balancing
- New small i2 petrol, small v4 diesel, med v4 diesel, med r7 diesel, large i2 diesel, large v6 diesel

*r631
- Update courtesy of thegrb93.
- Increased anti-crash torque limit.

*r633
- Added 40mm CL, 6 round parentable smoke/flare launcher
- Slightly buffed 40mm SL
- Reds balancing stuff
-- HEAT damage buffed
-- HEAT damage decreased to fuel tanks
-- HMG mag sizes increased 50%
-- HMG reload time reduced by a couple seconds
-- HMG other minor buffs
-- RAC minor buffing and adjustments
-- HRAC 20/30 magazine is 80/60 rounds respectively
-- HRAC 20/30 reload is 4/6 seconds respectively
-- HRAC slight pen buff
-- HRAC minor fire rate nerf
-- HRAC 30 weight reduced 1000 kg
-- (blame HRAC changes on people mounting twin hracs and spraying nonstop)
-- MG spread increased from 0.16 to 0.24
-- AC spread decreased from 0.16 to 0.12
-- SC spread decreased from 0.24 to 0.2
-- Med v4 horsepower increased from 148 to 209

*r634
- Fixed an exploit with HP rounds
- Modified crate ammo capacity to be a bit more consistent with model, courtesy of RDC
- Slightly bumped up crate capacity bonus

*r636
- Fixed 140sc model size FINALLY, courtesy of Wizzard Lizzard and RDC

*r637
- Rebalanced all Ground Turbine engines, torque nerfed drastically but HP remaining the same.
- GGTs now act more like piston engines in that they do not have instant torque from idle and require to sit at a certain rpm to be efficient.
- Added some Lockheed Bitchin' Betty F22 sounds from Serif

*r642
- Added new E2 functions:
-- ENTITY:acfReloadTime() - returns time to next shot of an ACF weapon
-- ENTITY:acfMagReloadTime() - returns time it takes for an ACF weapon to reload magazine
-- ENTITY:acfReloadProgress() - returns reload progress of an ACF weapon, useful for progress bars

*r643
- 'Fixed' killicons
-- Added ACF.EnableKillicons global variable to enable or disable 'fixed' killicons
-- Added ACF torch killicon
-- Added acf_gun killicon
- Fixed ACF_HE() argument naming
- Fixed ACF_HE() usage in HE, APHE, HEAT ammunition

*r645
- new 140sc models were in the wrong folder

*r653
- Added jojobull's old wheel models
- Added peniscolada's old steering wheel models
- Optimized mem usage of tracing in ACF ballistics and HE damage
- Replacing gun/engine sound with an empty path string will disable sound
- ACF menu now shows spread for guns
- Added e2func entity:acfGetLinkedWheels(), which returns any wheels directly linked to this or drivetrain children
- Fixed first-load for guns at spawn
-- Guns will now load their first round after spawning instantly, when a linked crate is activated
-- Fixed first-load shotgunning exploit
- Fixed crate over-capacity when unloading a gun too fast
- Fixed unload skipping mag reload time
- Fixed guns immediately showing full mag when starting reload
- Fixed e2func isReloading
- Fixed MASK_SHOT (ie passing through chain link fences) caliber being <3mm, not the intended <30mm
- Added prop_dynamic to ballistics filter
- Crates now cook off rounds from a random point inside the model
- Crates with 1 round left will immediately detonate instead of cooking off the last shell
-- Empty crates will still be safe, not dealing damage on detonation
-- Single 120mm 1x1x6 crates are a lot more volatile now
- Cookoff explosion now uses the avg pos of contributing crates, not origin of the first crate
- HE damage will ignite 33% of destroyed props
- Props destroyed by acf damage will also process their children, creating additional debris
-- Amount of debris generated by processing children is limited to reduce lag
-- Processed children that are ammo or fuel will immediately detonate
-- AP damage that kills a parent will process children as if it was exploding
--- This is purely for looks, as a directional spray of debris unrelated to the hit would look strange
- Engines now include linked wheels as a startpoint for mass ratio calculation
- Ballistics will not check visclips on makesphere props
- Much more robust checking of basic legality
-- Guns will also check seats for legality
-- Random legality check every 5 to 25 seconds (avg 15s), with a 35 second lockout if not legal
-- Ent overlay will tell you the remaining lockout time and what caused it
-- Added a convar "acf_modelswap_legal", which defaults to 0 (not legal)
- HEAT now has a crush speed that limits effective velocity
-- From 800 m/s to 1200 m/s, filler used to power the heat jet is proportionally converted into HE charge
-- Under 800 m/s, HEAT behaves normally; over 1200 m/s the HEAT jet cannot form and is purely HE
- Buffed B6 med multifuel: 255 -> 286 hp. Renamed to 8.3L; this will break old dupes
- Buffed B6 large: 604 -> 661 hp. Renamed to 15.8L; this will break old dupes
- Buffed R7 petrols: health +50%, torque loss from damage reduced 20%
- Buffed R7 small: 126 -> 189 hp
- Buffed R7 med petrol: 228 -> 302 hp
- Buffed R7 large: 600 -> 714 hp
- Buffed V6P large: 800 -> 675 kg, adjusted powerband to increase torque
- Buffed V6D large: 1200 -> 900 kg, adjusted powerband to drastically increase torque
- Buffed V8D large: 1500 -> 1200 kg
